[VMMaker]{:target="_blank"} allows any programmer to develop a customized
virtual machine for any platform. VMMaker comprises the VM simulator that is
used to develop the VM using the full power of the IDE, and a Smalltalk-to-C or
Smalltalk-to-JavaScript translator that produces the sources for the production
VM.
