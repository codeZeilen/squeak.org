## How to add your Squeak project
If you want your project to be listed on https://squeak.org/projects/, simply open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and add your project's logo to [img/projects](img/projects) as well as a markdown file to [_projects](_projects). We will then review your description and logo, which will usually result in a quick accept and update of our website.

For example, the markdown file *myproject.md* should look like this:

```markdown
---
title:      My Project
img-src:    projects/myprojectlogo.png
href:       http://www.myprojectwebsite.com
---
Brief description about my project goes here.
```

The logo should have the size of 200x200 pixels. The description should be in English and consist of about 50 words or less. Please choose a distinctive name for the files (i.e. markdown and logo). Double-check with the [existing projects](_projects).
