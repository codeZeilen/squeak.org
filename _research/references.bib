  abstract="Despite the undisputed prominence of inheritance as the fundamental reuse mechanism in object-oriented programming languages, the main variants---single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and mixin inheritance---all suffer from conceptual and practical problems. In the first part of this paper, we identify and illustrate these problems. We then present traits, a simple compositional model for structuring object-oriented programs. A trait is essentially a group of pure methods that serves as a building block for classes and is a primitive unit of code reuse. In this model, classes are composed from a set of traits by specifying glue code that connects the traits together and accesses the necessary state. We demonstrate how traits overcome the problems arising from the different variants of inheritance, we discuss how traits can be implemented effectively, and we summarize our experience applying traits to refactor an existing class hierarchy.",

  abstract="The programming languages of today are stuck in a deep rut that has developed over the past 50 years. Although we are faced with new challenges posed by enormous advances in hardware and internet technology, we continue to struggle with old-fashioned languages based on rigid, static, closed-world file-based views of programming. We argue the need for a new class of dynamic languages that support a view of programming as constant evolution of living and open software models. Such languages would require features such as dynamic first-class namespaces, explicit meta-models, optional, pluggable type systems, and incremental compilation of running software systems.",

This roundtable session will use the motivating example of safely modeling and studying the major factors affecting virus propagation to demonstrate how educators can use Squeak Etoys to create virtual laboratories. Participants will be led through a process of identifying features to model, designing objects and behaviors to represent those features, implementing the selected representations, and instrumenting a model using Squeak Etoys. },

  abstract  = { Information technology (IT) skills consistent with the National Educational Technology Standards for Students (NETS-S) are often not well integrated with science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) course content. As a result, students make sparse connections between the acquisition and application of IT skills. The USeIT project addresses this problem by training teachers and students to use Squeak Etoys software to model STEM concepts. Novel interfaces developed by the USeIT project have facilitated the integration of sensor probes with the Squeak Etoys environment. Recent USeIT project work extends the interfaces to include device controllers, thus enabling a complete control loop. The enhanced Etoys environment highlights the vital connections between technology, science, engineering, and mathematics and the integrative nature of information technology. },

This roundtable session will use the motivating example of safely modeling and studying the major factors affecting virus propagation to demonstrate how educators can use Squeak Etoys to create virtual laboratories.

The main interface for SimBuilder is a user interface designed to aid users in the interactive design and manipulation of simulation microworlds. In keeping with the iterative software process for the development of SimBuilder, a research study was conducted to determine the usability of the creation toolkit for simulation microworlds. The data collected contributes toward the redesign of SimBuilder. Necessary improvements were discovered including a redesign of the paint tool used to draw candidate players or objects. },

Guidelines ranged from suggestions as to the age range of children the environment should be aimed at, through to the necessity of making the environment fun.

Twenty-four teachers who participated in the study successfully developed their own educational computer programs in the educational technology course employing cognitive apprenticeship and pair programming approaches as the primary instructional strategies. Two educational software programs created by the participating teachers were described in order to explain what they were trying to do using Etoys and how they accomplished their goals. The results of an anonymous survey evaluating the difficulty of and the attitude toward learning Etoys indicate that teachers enjoyed learning Etoys and would like to continue to use it in the future although they found it was slightly more difficult, compared to their self-evaluated computer skill. The strengths and weaknesses of Etoys, the difficult computer programming concepts, and the educational implications of Etoys programming were also discussed. (Contains 5 tables and 6 figures.) },

Solving a science challenge was the overall goal for the students in the program, while reading science articles and writing related journal responses allowed the students to unknowingly improve reading comprehension and writing skills. An experiment was conducted and results were compiled based on an ongoing assessment of the students and a final survey. The findings of this study suggest that the Squeak SimBuilder e-learning technology can be successfully used to enhance reading literacy in a group of fourth and fifth grade students. },

Results of this study suggest that even a limited exposure to a creative programming environment can not only provide students with an awareness and understanding of how computers are programmed, but can also increase females self-confidence and interest in computer programming. An evaluation of all female versus mixed-gender workshops suggest that an all-female environment may create a more efficient learning environment for adolescent females when teaching traditionally male-dominated topics such as computers. },

This introduction summarizes how the six articles describe specific ITEST teacher development projects, provide portraits of these projects, and address important themes that cross ITEST professional development and STEM professional development more generally: building links between informal and formal education; using technology in innovative ways; integrating STEM content into professional development; reaching and engaging underrepresented populations; developing innovative professional development; and tightening the research/practice cycle. },

During a curriculum about the plant lifecycle, students were given observation questions that focused on either object characteristics in the Object-oriented group (N=9) or the scientific method in the Control group (N=8).  A post-test task to draw a plant at the end of the curriculum showed that there was no statistical differences found between the two groups.  However, interesting findings about the nature of the observations between the two groups include a greater number of total labels and a greater number of property and relationship labels in the plant drawings by the Object-oriented group. Further research in applying Object-orientation to thinking is implicated. },
